## 2. `README.md` for a Git Repository

Here is a full `README.md` you can drop into a repo (e.g. `pab-manifesto`):

# Physically Active Bits (PAB) — Post-Binary Manifesto

> “What if a simulated environment could produce real-world output?”

This repository documents the conceptual, mathematical, and architectural framework for **Physically Active Bits (PABs)** — a next-generation computational substrate where bits are not just logical states, but physically capable units that can move, exert forces, and reconfigure matter under program control.

The goal is to formalize and share a blueprint for **programmable matter** and **computation-driven construction**, and to secure early intellectual stake in this architectural space.

## Vision

Classical bits are static: they flip, but they do not move or build. All physical work is delegated to external actuators and manufacturing systems.

PABs change that.

A **Physically Active Bit (PAB)** is defined by:

- Logical state: `sᵢ`
- Position in space: `rᵢ`
- Local actuation capabilities: `Fᵢ`
- Access to energy: `Eᵢ`

Formally:

```text
PABᵢ = (sᵢ, rᵢ, Fᵢ, Eᵢ)
